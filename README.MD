# Art Gallery

A simple web application that allows artists to upload and showcase their artwork online.

## Project Overview

Art Gallery is a basic full-stack Java web app built with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. It lets users:

- Upload artwork images
- Add titles, descriptions for each piece
- View a public gallery of all uploaded artworks
- Click on a piece to see more details

The goal is to provide a simple, clean space to display creative work, while also learning key backend concepts like:

- File uploads
- REST API design
- Database modeling with JPA
- Frontend integration using HTML and JavaScript

## Tech Stack

- Java + Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL
- HTML/CSS + JavaScript (for the frontend)
- Git + GitHub (version control)
